# What is Swolebot?

Due to Covid-19, home exercise equipment is at an all-time low. Imagine if there was a way to get notified when things are back in stock automatically, without relying on Rogue Fitness' unrealible email notification?

There's a simple way to do this as scale using very limited resources and reducing the burden on Rogue Fitness' servers. Every 5 minutes, this script will poll several pages and download only the HTML for a single page. After which, it will process this file and alert you AND open a web browser window for you. 

# Installation

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

```âš¡ python3 swole.py

Welcome to Swolebot. Let's park in front of Rogue Fitness until our stuff is in stock!

IMPORTANT NOTE: - Use exact product names or suffer the consequences.
- For example, you'll want to search for "Black Concept 2 Model 2 Rower - PM5" and not "Black."
- However, you may wish to search for "The Ohio Bar" to find all variants for sale.

This seems to be your first time running Swolebot... let's set it up.

# Quick Tips

You can edit `keywords.txt` and include line-separated search terms to search for anything. I recommend using full product names to avoid adding too many alerts.
